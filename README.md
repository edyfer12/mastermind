# mastermind

The game Mastermind is played between two players, computer and human. At first the player will be asked the number of games they want to play.
Then the human player is nominated randomly whether they would be selected as either the codemaker or the guesser. For this game there are rules
whether to include duplicate and/or blank colours when making colour code so the guesser can select colours and be provided feedback. It is for
the human player to choose the rules for both guesser and codemaker. Every time the guesser selects the colour, the codemaker provides the feedback
to the guesser by providing black, white or blank key peg. The black key peg is provided to the guesser if the colour and position both match the row of the 
codemaker. Whereas, if the colour selected by the guesser matches the colour but not position of the codemaker's, then the white key peg
is provided to the guesser. But when the colour does not exist or the existing number of duplicate colour in the guesser row exceeds the numbers
in codemakers, then no key peg is provided. Throughout the whole game, the guesser has 12 turns to get the colour pattern correct. Each turn is 1 point scored for the
codemaker. An extra 1 point is scored if the guesser did not get the pattern right on the last attempt. If all the four colours in the guesser match the codemaker's, 
then the game is finished.
